# Transformer Fault Diagnosis Using Feature Transformation and Resampling

## Overview
I have developed an improved approach to resampling by incorporating feature transformation techniques. The goal is to enhance the distribution of resampled data, allowing for more accurate when calculation distance (Euclidean, etc).

### Transformations Techniques
- **Log**
- **Log1p**
- **Square Root**
- **Boxcox**
- **Yeo-Johnson**

### Resampling Techniques
- **Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)**
- **Edited Nearest Neighbors (ENN)**
- **SMOTE-ENN**
- **ADASYNN**
- **Nearmiss**
- **ADASYNN-Nearmiss**
- **ADASYNN-ENN**

The DGA dataset undergoes transformations to stabilize distributions and reduce class overlap, followed by resampling to balance the dataset and eliminate noisy samples.
